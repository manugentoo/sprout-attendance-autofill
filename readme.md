# Attendance Autofill Chrome Extension

A lightweight Chrome extension that automates filling out attendance logs in Sprout HR by:

- Dynamically adding rows for each weekday within a specified date range
- Setting `In` and `Out` types
- Assigning the correct date and time values (08:00 for In, 17:00 for Out)
- Skipping weekends
- Simulating human-like interaction to bypass form validation requiring manual input
